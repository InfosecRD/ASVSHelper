## v3.7 - Verify that all successful authentication and re-authentication generates a new session and session id.

### Why is this required?

Generating new session IDs will help prevent a type of attack called "session fixation" in which a malicious user hijacks a valid session.

### Applicability (Level 1)

This objective applies to all apps that handle user sessions.

### Guidelines for developers

Session information should be handled by third-party authentication services.
