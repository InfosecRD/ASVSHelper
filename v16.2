## v16.2 - Verify that untrusted file data submitted to the application is not used directly with file I/O commands, particularly to protect against path traversal, local file include, file mime type, and OS command injection vulnerabilities.

### Why is this required?

Allowing uploaded file data to have direct access to file I/O commands leaves an application vulnerable to OS command injection as well as path traversal, which allows attackers to access information about the file structure of the app.

### Applicability (Level 1)

This objective applies to all apps.

### Guidelines for developers

Sanitize all user inputs that include file names and/or commands.  However, Architecture must minimize need for user to input file data.
