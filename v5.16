## v5.16 - If the application framework allows automatic mass parameter assignment (also called automatic variable binding) from the inbound request to a model, verify that security sensitive fields such as “accountBalance”, “role” or “password” are protected from malicious automatic binding.

### Why is this required?

TODO

### Applicability (Level 2)

This objective applies to all apps.

### Guidelines for developers

Minimize mass parameter assignment only to fields that require it.
