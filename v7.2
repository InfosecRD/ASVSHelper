## v7.2 - Verify that all cryptographic modules fail securely, and errors are handled in a way that does not enable oracle padding.

### Why is this required?

#### Padding Oracle Attack

All modern encryption methods create ciphertext by encrypting blocks of bits all containing the same number of bits, typically 128.  Therefore, if a message contains a number of bits that isn't evenly divisible by 128, then additional bits must be appended to the end of the message before encryption.  In fact, even if the original message length is divisible by 128, the message is still padded with exactly 128 bits.

The padding algorithm determines what the padding should look like, and if a decrypted cipher yields an invalid padding, then the cipher itself was invalid.  As it turns out, if an attacker learns that a given ciphertext can yield a legitimate plaintext, then the attacker can break the cipher.

Here is a [link](https://robertheaton.com/2013/07/29/padding-oracle-attack/) that can help explain the padding oracle attack in more detail.

### Applicability (Level 1)

This objective applies to all apps.

### Guidelines for developers

The response generated by a service should be identical regardless of whether the cipher was correct or not.  If the response code is 200 for a valid ciphertext and 500 for an invalid ciphertext, then an attacker can perform a padding oracle attack.
