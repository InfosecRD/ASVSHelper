## v3.1 - Verify that there is no custom session manager, or that the custom session manager is resistant against all common session management attacks.

### Why is this required?

Session management attacks are a common entry point for malicious users.  Custom session managers can be vulnerable because they have not been tested repeatedly against the most common forms of attack and improved over time.

### Applicability (Level 1)

This objective applies to all apps that track user sessions.

### Guidelines for developers

Only approved and industry standard session management tools must be used.
