## v16.5 - Verify that untrusted data is not used within cross-domain resource sharing (CORS) to protect against arbitrary remote content.

### Why is this required?

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) allows restricted resources on one domain to be requested from a different domain using mechanisms such as AJAX.

### Applicability (Level 1)

This objective applies to all apps.

### Guidelines for developers

Any iFrames, etc. must only include trusted data.
