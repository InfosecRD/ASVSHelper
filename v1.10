## v1.10 - Verify that there is no sensitive business logic, secret keys or other proprietary information in client side code.

### Why is this required?

TODO

### Applicability (Level 2)

This objective applies to all apps.

### Guidelines for developers

During design, client side code should never include any sensitive information.  Treat all code as though it can be edited freely by a malicious user.  Secret keys should be stored in a vault and only accessible via whitelisted IP addresses.
