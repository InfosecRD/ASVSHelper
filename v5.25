## v5.25 - Verify when parsing JSON in browsers, that JSON.parse is used to parse JSON on the client. Do not use eval() to parse JSON on the client.

### Why is this required?

Using `eval()` to parse JSON is very unsafe, as the `eval()` function can potentially execute harmful script.

### Applicability (Level 2)

This objective applies to all apps.

### Guidelines for developers

All instances of eval() used to parse JSON data must be updated.
