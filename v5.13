## v5.13 - Verify that the application is not susceptible to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) or Local File Inclusion (LFI) when content is used that is a path to a file.

### Why is this required?

TODO

### Applicability (Level 1)

This objective applies to all apps that dynamically reference external files or allow users to upload files.

### Guidelines for developers

Sanitize all GET/POST/PUT parameters to ensure that inputs cannot link to untrusted directories or crawl through directories.  If possible, only permit whitelisted files to be included.
