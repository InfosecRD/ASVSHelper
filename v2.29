### Why is this required?

Many breaches have occurred because of keys that were stored in online repositories such as GitHub.  In one example, a hacker accessed the Uber database by finding login credentials that had ben uploaded onto Uber's GitHub.

### Applicability (Level 3)

This objective applies to all apps.

### Guidelines for developers

Keys must be stored in a protected vault.  Do not store keys in `.properties` files, because they can be compromised as well as code can, especially if they are stored in online repositories such as GitHub.
