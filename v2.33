## v2.33 - Browser autocomplete, and integration with password managers are permitted unless prohibited by risk based policy.

### Why is this required?

Allowing browsers to integrate with password managers encourages users to use more complicated passwords with high entropy.  If users are forced to memorize passwords, then they are more likely to use passwords that are easy to guess because they are easier to remember.  Password managers encourage more difficult, randomized passwords because the users are not then required to remember it.
