## v10.3 - Verify that TLS is used for all connections (including both external and backend connections) that are authenticated or that involve sensitive data or functions, and does not fall back to insecure or unencrypted protocols. Ensure the strongest alternative is the preferred algorithm.

### Why is this required?

TODO

### Applicability (Level 1)

This objective applies to all apps.

### Guidelines for developers

All connections must use TLS v1.2. Do not allow stepping down to a lower security protocol.
