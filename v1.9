## v1.9 - Verify the application has a clear separation between the data layer, controller layer and the display layer, such that security decisions can be enforced on trusted systems.

### Why is this required?

Separation of the data layer from other layers is an integral part of ensuring data security because it allows the data layer to carefully restrict entry points only to a small number of trusted sources.

### Applicability (Level 2)

This objective applies to all apps.

### Guidelines for developers

Ensure that display layer is only performing display layer functionality and that controller layer is only performing controller layer functionality.
