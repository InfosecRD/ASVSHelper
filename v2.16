Unencrypted or poorly-encrypted credentials are highly susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.

### Applicability (Level 1)

This objective applies to all apps.

### Guidelines for developers

All communication between client and server must use TLS 1.2 with a valid certificate.  Stepping down fom TLS 1.2 must be prohibited.
