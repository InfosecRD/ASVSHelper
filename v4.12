## v4.12 - Verify that all access control decisions can be logged and all failed decisions are logged.

### Why is this required?

Logging of access control decisions, particularly those of failed login attempts, is essential for being able to perform audits after a malicious user has attempted to access the system, particularly if the malicious user is attempting brute-force attacks.

### Applicability (Level 2)

This objective applies to all apps.

### Guidelines for developers

Implement logging of all access control decisions.  Enure that all user input included in log files is sanitized.
