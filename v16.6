## v16.6 - Verify that files obtained from untrusted sources are stored outside the webroot, with limited permissions, preferably with strong validation.

### Why is this required?

Even with anti-virus scanning, it is always possible for an untrusted file to contain malicious content that is not caught during scanning (i.e., a zero-day attack).

### Applicability (Level 2)

This objective applies to all apps.

### Guidelines for developers

Create sandbox for storage of external files.
