## v10.1 - Verify that a path can be built from a trusted CA to each Transport Layer Security (TLS) server certificate, and that each server certificate is valid.

### Why is this required?

Security certificates must be signed by a trusted Certificate Authority.  Accepting untrusted certificates makes an app susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle attacks because, without the Certificate Authority signature, there is no way of distingushing between a valid source and a malicious source.

### Applicability (Level 1)

This objective applies to all apps.
