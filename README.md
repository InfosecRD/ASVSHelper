# OWASP ASVS Users Guide 

This guide will serve to teach developers how to implement the OWASP ASVS security guidelines.  This document is not meant to serve as a checklist!  It is here as a resource for developers requiring clarification of how to design secure code.

The ASVS Checklist also includes levels ranging from 1 through 3.  All programs must comply with level 1 requirements.  Programs designated as level 2 will have more sensitive data and must comply with level 1 and level 2 requirements.  Finally, programs designated as level 3 will have the most sensitive data (such as payment card information) and must comply with all requirements.
