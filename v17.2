## v17.2 - Verify that the mobile app does not store sensitive data onto potentially unencrypted shared resources on the device (e.g. SD card or shared folders).

### Why is this required?

TODO

### Applicability (Level 1)

This objective applies to mobile apps that handle any sensitive data (e.g., personal information or credit card information).

### Guidelines for developers

Sensitive data should not be stored on the device unless necessary, and must be encrypted when it is stored on the device.  Credit card information must never be stored on the device.
