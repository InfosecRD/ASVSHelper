## v2.32 - Verify that administrative interfaces are not accessible to untrusted parties

### Why is this required?

If a malicious user is able to access an administrative interface, even if they are not allowed to make edits, then they will be able to glean useful information with regards to the security policies and set-up of the app and can attempt to exploit them.

### Applicability (Level 1)

This objective applies to all apps.

### Guidelines for developers

Administrative interfaces should only be accessible from internal IP addresses and should not be accessible from any public network.
