## v4.5 - Verify that directory browsing is disabled unless deliberately desired. Additionally, applications should not allow discovery or disclosure of file or directory metadata, such as Thumbs.db, .DS_Store, .git or .svn folders.

### Why is this required?

TODO

### Applicability (Level 1)

This objective applies to all apps.

### Guidelines for developers

Ensure that all directories either have a default page or will redirect the user to a default page.  Ensure all metadata files are inaccessible and will result in a browser redirect.
