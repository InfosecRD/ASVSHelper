## v2.26 - Verify that risk based re-authentication, two factor or transaction signing is in place for high value transactions.

### Why is this required?

Two-factor authentication entails requiring a user to identify themselves using two of the following three authentication factors: something they know, something they have, and something they are.  An example would be if a user, to log in, must use their fingerprint (something they are), then enter a password (something they know).

The purpose of this requirement is to thwart malicious users who may have access to one of the factors.  For example, if a malicious user is able to compromise a user's password, the password is useless to them unless they also are able to compromise the additional factor.  For example, if a login requires both a password and a response to an SMS text, then a malicious user still cannot log in unless they both compromise a user's password *and* access their phone.

### Applicability (Level 2)

This objective applies to apps that will entail access to high-value resources.

### Guidelines for developers

It will be the role of developers and/or a system architect to determine which resources should be considered high-value.  At a minimum, any administrator account that has access to personally identifiable information (PII) or payment card information (PCI) must be considered high-value.
