## v3.6 - Verify that the session id is never disclosed in URLs, error messages, or logs. This includes verifying that the application does not support URL rewriting of session cookies.

### Why is this required?

It is common for malicious users to intercept URL information of requests, because very often they can find useful information in the URL, particularly if a web app uses GET requests.  If session information is sent via GET request, then it is availble unencrypted to any malicious user.

### Applicability (Level 1)

This objective applies to all apps that use sessions.

### Guidelines for developers

Never use GET requests to communicate session information, since GET requests store the variables in a URL that is easy for a malicious man-in-the-middle to intercept.

Error messages must never be sent to the front end.  Errors must trigger a generic message to the user.  404 errors should redirect the user to another page.  All directories must have a landing page.
