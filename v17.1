## v17.1 - Verify that ID values stored on the device and retrievable by other applications, such as the UDID or IMEI number are not used as authentication tokens.

### Why is this required?

ID values of the device are essentially user input, and must be treated as such.  It is possible for a malicious user to alter the ID of the device to masquerade as a different device.

### Applicability (Level 1)

This objective applies to mobile apps that use device ID data.

### Guidelines for developers

ID values from the device flor UX purposes may be used but must always be considered untrusted, since they can be spoofed by malicious users.
