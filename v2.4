## v2.4 - Verify all authentication controls are enforced on the server side.

### Why is this required?

Any authentication controls enforced on the client side can be defeated by a malicious user.  It is very easy for a client to alter any HTML or JavaScript code to override authentication controls.

### Applicability (Level 1)

This objective applies to all apps.

### Guidelines for developers

All authentication services must be handled via third-party apps such as Auth0.
