## v3.10 - Verify that only session ids generated by the application framework are recognized as active by the application.

### Why is this required?

Any session information not generated by the framework must be considered untrustworthy as its source cannot be validated.  The framework must be designed so that all session ids are generated in one location.

### Applicability (Level 2)

This objective applies to all apps.

### Guidelines for developers

Verify all session ids with third-party session manager.  Only accept session ids that third-party manager accepts as valid and active.
