## v11.1 - Verify that the application accepts only a defined set of required HTTP request methods, such as GET and POST are accepted, and unused methods (e.g. TRACE, PUT, and DELETE) are explicitly blocked.

### Why is this required?

TODO

### Applicability (Level 1)

This objective applies to all apps that perform web services.

### Guidelines for developers

Ensure that any request method not specifically permitted is blocked and returns a Bad Request error.
