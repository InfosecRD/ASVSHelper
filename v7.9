## v7.9 - Verify that there is an explicit policy for how cryptographic keys are managed (e.g., generated, distributed, revoked, and expired). Verify that this key lifecycle is properly enforced.

### Why is this required?

TODO

### Applicability (Level 2)

This objective applies to all apps.

### Guidelines for developers

Keys must never be stored in code or in .properties files that will be stored with code.  Keys must be stored in a secured vault.

A key rotation policy must be clearly established.
